# my-conquer

This is my version of the Conquer Template found here: https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page196/conquer

I am using it as an opportunity to practice Flexbox and other css layout methods.  While the original Conquer uses Bootstrap, mine does not.
Also a chance to practice responsive design.  Fun stuff!
